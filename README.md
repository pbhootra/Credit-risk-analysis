# Credit-risk-analysis
This mini project involves building a SQL-driven credit risk monitoring system. The goal is 
to identify high-risk customers based on their transaction patterns, loan history, and 
exposure levels, and generate early warning signals for risk management teams.


# Database Structure :
* Transactions: Daily transaction records with amount and risk score - customer_risk
* Customer-level credit exposure and risk score 
* Loans: History of loan repayments and overdue status
* Credit_accounts:  Customer credit limit and usage
* Credit_data: Monthly aggregated credit exposure for trend analysis
